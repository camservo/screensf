      long: "Before “Love Jones,” black romance on the big screen was hard to come by. Sure, “Mahogany,” starring Diana Ross and Billy Dee Williams, had paved the way, but that was in 1975. Since then, most of the movies featuring black people were about ‘hood life: poverty, gangs, drugs and guns. Someone was always dying by the time the credits rolled. \n \n Then, in 1997, came a simple movie about the love lives of black artists in Chicago. Starring Larenz Tate and Nia Long, writer-director Ted Witcher’s debut film followed the rise and fall, and rise again, of a relationship between a young poet named Darius Lovehall and Nina Mosley, a photographer. Set in the city’s spoken-word scene, “Love Jones” showcased a different aspect of black life, one where struggle and strife did not dictate one’s circumstances, where one’s group of friends, played by Isaiah Washington, Lisa Nicole Carson, Bill Bellamy and Leonard Roberts, were more like family. \n \nIt was the kind of film that white communities had known well. \n \nIn the 20 years since “Love Jones” was released on March 14, 1997, black love has found its way into films and television shows. Think “The Best Man” franchise, “Queen Sugar,” “Southside With You” and “Insecure,” to name a few. But where “Love Jones” should have been a catalyst, a more robust canon of romantic films featuring black couples hasn’t fully materialized. \n \nOn the film’s 20th anniversary, which saw the film honored at last month’s American Black Film Festival Awards, The Times shaped this oral history from conversations with the “Love Jones” cast and crew about how the film came to be, the impact of black love on screen in the 1990s and why the film is considered a classic. \n \n“Love Jones,” at its core, is about possibilities, those opportunities people of color know exist for them — in love, life and career. But it was difficult for Witcher as a first-time director to show those possibilities, especially when most black films on theater marquees at the time were more like “Menace II Society” and “Boyz N the Hood.” Hollywood wanted to make money, and it wasn’t clear that a black romantic drama could do that."
